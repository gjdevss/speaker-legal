Privacy Policy

		
Last Updated: 28th December, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Speaker (“Speaker,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use the Speaker mobile application and any related services, features, content, or applications (collectively, the “Service”).

By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of information as described herein.


1. About Speaker

Speaker is a mobile application that provides speech practice tools and automated feedback generated through software-based analysis of user-submitted audio and text.

Speaker does not provide professional voice coaching, speech therapy, medical advice, mental health services, educational instruction, or any regulated professional service. All feedback generated by the Service is automated, informational, and intended solely for general self-improvement and entertainment purposes.


2. Eligibility and Age Requirements

The Service is intended for users 13 years of age or older.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child under 13 has provided personal data to us, please contact us, and we will take reasonable steps to delete such information.

If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you represent that you have obtained parental or legal guardian consent to use the Service.

		
3. Information We Collect

We collect only the information reasonably necessary to operate, maintain, and improve the Service.

3.1 Account and Authentication Information

When you sign in to the Service using Apple or Google authentication, we receive:
	•	A unique user identifier (Firebase Authentication UID)
	•	Authentication provider identifier (Apple or Google)
	•	Account creation timestamp
	•	Platform and application version metadata

We do not require users to provide real names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, or government-issued identifiers.

Email addresses or display names may be provided by Apple or Google as part of authentication flows. We do not intentionally store or use this information beyond what is necessary to enable sign-in and account management.

3.2 User-Provided Content

When using the Service, you may voluntarily provide content, including:
	•	Audio recordings of your voice
	•	Spoken transcripts generated during sessions
	•	Written responses or reflections entered during drills

Important clarifications:
	•	Audio recordings are processed temporarily and deleted after analysis
	•	Raw transcripts are not stored in our databases
	•	Written responses and performance metrics are stored only to provide progress tracking and historical insights to you

3.3 Voice Analysis and Performance Data

We store derived and aggregated data generated during your use of the Service, including:
	•	Speaking scores (e.g., clarity, pace, coherence, confidence)
	•	Session timestamps and durations
	•	Word counts, filler counts, and similar metrics
	•	Drill completion history and progress indicators

We do not store raw audio recordings or raw speech transcripts on a long-term basis.

3.4 Local Device Data

Certain information is stored locally on your device to support core functionality, such as:
	•	Streaks and progress indicators
	•	Daily task states
	•	Drill progress

This data remains on your device and is removed when you delete your account.

5. Audio Processing and AI Services

5.1 Audio Handling

When you submit an audio recording:
	•	The audio file is uploaded to our backend infrastructure
	•	The audio is transmitted to third-party AI service providers for transcription and analysis
	•	The audio file is deleted immediately after processing
	•	We do not retain raw audio recordings

5.2 Automated Processing

We use automated systems and machine learning models to:
	•	Transcribe speech
	•	Generate feedback and performance scores

These automated processes are used solely to provide the Service and do not produce legal, medical, or similarly significant effects.

Third-party AI providers operate under their own privacy and data retention policies. We do not control how long such providers may retain data processed through their systems.

Speaker does not use individual user audio recordings or transcripts to train or fine-tune its own AI models. Third-party AI service providers may process submitted data in accordance with their own privacy and data retention policies, which may include model improvement or training. Speaker does not control these third-party practices.


6. Service Providers and Subprocessors

We rely on trusted third-party service providers to operate the Service, including:
	•	Firebase (Google) – authentication and database services
	•	Apple App Store – payments, subscriptions, and refunds
	•	RevenueCat – subscription status and entitlement management
	•	Cloud hosting providers – backend infrastructure
	•	AI service providers – speech transcription and automated analysis

These providers process data on our behalf in accordance with their own privacy policies and contractual obligations.


7. Payments and Subscriptions

All payments, subscriptions, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are handled exclusively by Apple through the Apple App Store.

Apple is the merchant of record for all in-app purchases.

We do not:
	•	Process payments directly
	•	Store payment credentials
	•	Access credit card or billing information
	•	Control refund or billing dispute decisions

Subscription status information is processed via RevenueCat to enable access control within the Service.

Speaker does not control and is not responsible for Apple’s payment processing, billing decisions, refund determinations, or subscription management policies.


8. User Content and Responsibility

You are solely responsible for the content you submit to the Service.

We do not:
	•	Review or verify user-generated content for accuracy
	•	Endorse user submissions
	•	Guarantee the correctness or usefulness of automated feedback

You agree not to submit content that is unlawful, abusive, defamatory, infringing, or otherwise violates applicable laws or third-party rights.


9. Data Retention
	•	Account and performance data is retained until you delete your account
	•	Audio recordings are deleted immediately after processing
	•	Raw transcripts are not persisted
	•	Local device data is removed upon account deletion

When you delete your account:
	•	Your authentication account is removed
	•	Associated stored data is deleted or anonymized within a reasonable period, subject to legal, security and operational requirements
	•	Local device data is cleared

Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

The Service does not provide professional, medical, therapeutic, or educational advice. You use the Service at your own discretion and risk.

We are not responsible for decisions, actions, or outcomes resulting from reliance on the Service.

Additional limitations of liability are described in the Terms of Use.
