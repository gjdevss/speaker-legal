    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 28, 2025</div>

    <div class="content">

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Voky AI mobile application and any related services, features, content, or applications (collectively, the “Service”), operated by Voky AI (“Voky AI,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Service.


1. The Service

Voky AI is a software-based mobile application that provides speech practice tools and automated feedback generated through analysis of user-submitted audio and text.

The Service:
	•	is fully automated
	•	provides informational feedback only
	•	is intended solely for general self-improvement and entertainment purposes

Voky AI does not provide professional voice coaching, speech therapy, medical advice, mental health services, educational instruction, or any regulated professional service. No information provided by the Service constitutes professional advice or creates a professional-client relationship.


2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service.

If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you represent and warrant that you have obtained consent from a parent or legal guardian.

Voky AI does not knowingly permit use of the Service by children under 13. If such use is identified, we may suspend or terminate access without notice.


3. Account Registration and Security

Certain features require you to authenticate using Apple or Google sign-in.

You agree that:
	•	all information associated with your account is accurate and lawful
	•	you are responsible for all activity conducted through your account
	•	you will not share, sell, or misuse access credentials

Voky AI is not responsible for unauthorized access resulting from loss of your device, compromise of your account, or failure to secure your credentials.


4. User Content

4.1 Your Responsibility

You may submit content to the Service, including audio recordings, written text, and other inputs required to operate the Service (“User Content”).

You retain ownership of your User Content. However, you are solely responsible for it and for any consequences arising from its submission.

You agree not to submit User Content that:
	•	is unlawful, abusive, defamatory, or fraudulent
	•	infringes intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights
	•	violates applicable laws or regulations
	•	contains malware or interferes with the Service

Voky AI does not actively monitor User Content for accuracy or legality and assumes no responsibility for it.

4.2 License to Operate the Service

By submitting User Content, you grant Voky AI a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to process such content solely for the purpose of operating, maintaining, securing, and explaining the Service, including:
	•	temporary audio processing
	•	transcription
	•	automated analysis
	•	generation of feedback and performance metrics

Voky AI does not use individual user audio recordings or transcripts to train or fine-tune its own AI models. Third-party AI service providers may process submitted data in accordance with their own privacy and data retention policies, which may include model improvement or training. Voky AI does not control these third-party practices.


5. Automated Nature of the Service

You acknowledge and agree that:
	•	all outputs are generated automatically by software systems
	•	outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, subjective, or misleading
	•	results may vary between sessions and users
	•	no human review or verification is guaranteed

You agree not to rely on the Service for decisions with legal, medical, therapeutic, educational, financial, or similarly significant consequences.


6. Third-Party Services and AI Processing

The Service relies on third-party service providers, including cloud infrastructure, analytics, authentication, subscription management, and AI processing providers.

Voky AI does not control third-party services and is not responsible for their availability, accuracy, or data-handling practices. Third-party providers may process submitted data in accordance with their own privacy policies, which may include model improvement or training. Voky AI does not control these third-party practices.


7. Subscriptions, Payments, and Billing

7.1 Apple as Merchant of Record

All payments, subscriptions, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are handled exclusively through the Apple App Store.

Apple is the merchant of record for all in-app purchases.

Voky AI:
	•	does not process payments
	•	does not store payment credentials
	•	does not control billing decisions, refunds, or subscription management

Any billing disputes must be resolved directly with Apple.

7.2 Subscription Access

Subscription status is processed via RevenueCat to enable or disable feature access within the Service.

Access to paid features may change immediately upon subscription expiration, cancellation, refund, or payment failure.

Deleting the app does not cancel an active subscription.


8. Acceptable Use Restrictions

You agree not to:
	•	reverse engineer, decompile, or scrape the Service
	•	use automated tools to access or copy the Service
	•	interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure
	•	use the Service for unlawful, abusive, or exploitative purposes

Voky AI may investigate and take appropriate action for violations, including suspension or termination.


9. No Warranties

The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Voky AI disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including accuracy, reliability, fitness for a particular purpose, and availability.

Voky AI does not guarantee improvement of speech, confidence, performance, or outcomes.


10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

Voky AI shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including loss of data, profits, reputation, or emotional distress.

Voky AI’s total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid to Voky AI (if any) in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.


11. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Voky AI and its affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from:
	•	your use of the Service
	•	your User Content
	•	your violation of these Terms
	•	your violation of applicable law or third-party rights


12. Suspension and Termination

Voky AI may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time if:
	•	you violate these Terms
	•	your use poses legal, security, or operational risk
	•	required by law or platform policies

You may terminate your account at any time through the app.

Upon termination, data is handled in accordance with the Privacy Policy.


13. Modifications to the Service or Terms

Voky AI may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service or update these Terms at any time.

Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.


14. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the European Union and the laws of the Member State in which Voky AI is established, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

Nothing in these Terms limits mandatory consumer protections under applicable law.


15. Entire Agreement

These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Voky AI regarding the Service.

If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force.


16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

16.1 Informal Resolution First

Before initiating any formal legal action, you agree to first contact Voky AI to attempt to resolve the dispute informally by emailing support@Voky AI.app with a description of the issue.
Voky AI will make a good-faith effort to respond within a reasonable period.

16.2 Binding Arbitration

Except as set forth below, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Service, or your relationship with Voky AI (each, a “Dispute”) shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration, rather than in court.

Arbitration shall be conducted by a neutral arbitrator under the rules of a recognized arbitration body agreed upon by the parties, or, if no agreement is reached, under rules determined by the arbitrator consistent with applicable law.

16.3 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Voky AI agree that all Disputes must be brought in an individual capacity only, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, or consolidated action.

The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.

16.4 Exceptions to Arbitration

Nothing in this section prevents either party from:
	•	bringing an individual claim in small claims court, if the claim qualifies; or
	•	seeking injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent unauthorized use, misuse, or infringement of intellectual property or confidential information.

16.5 Location and Procedures

Unless otherwise required by applicable law, arbitration will take place in a location reasonably convenient to you, or may be conducted remotely.

Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs, except where applicable law requires otherwise.

16.6 Governing Law

This arbitration agreement is governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws specified in the Governing Law section of these Terms, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

16.7 Opt-Out Right

You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to support@Voky AI.app within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.
Your notice must include your name and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration.

Opting out of arbitration does not affect any other provision of these Terms.

16.8 Consumer Rights

Nothing in this section limits any rights you may have under mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction.
